# Cool Employee Tracker

## My Task

In this assignment I built a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using node.js, inquirer, and MYSQL.

This application wonâ€™t be deployed, I also created a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality.

## User Story

```
AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business

```

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
 
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd my-project
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm run start
```
